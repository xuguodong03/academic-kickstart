I am currently a second-year PhD candidate in the [MMLAB](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/), The Chinese University of Hong Kong. I am supervised by Prof. [Chen Change Loy](http://personal.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/~ccloy/index.html) and Prof. [Xiaoou Tang](https://www.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/people/xotang.shtml). I received my B.Eng degree from Tsinghua University in July 2018, supervised by Prof. [Jian Yuan](http://www.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/ee/4157/2010/20101217151546455509516/20101217151546455509516_.html). 

My research interests include video object segmentation, self-supervised learning and knowledge distillation.
